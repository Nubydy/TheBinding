        <h1>How Did Isaac come to be?</h1>
        <h5>Edmund McMillen, had just come off of the success of his previous game "Super Meat Boy" and wanted to make a Roguelike game of his childhood with dark and twisted religious stuff in it. He felt like an outcast due to him being such a creative kid in his early life in a devout christian and catholic family, having constantly be told that his drawings will make him go to hell and constantly being told that he is "Evil and bad" and that his drawings were wicked. The game is just like his other game with it story wise about how a kid recedes into his imagination to be safe but only his imagination is full of terrible and awful things that are all mirroring his bad versions of himself that are trying to harm him. So he made a game about that which is "TBOI:R"</h5>
        <h2>My review on "TBOI:R"</h2>
        <p>
        <blockquote><em>The Binding Of Isaac: Rebirth</em> Is and will be one of my favorite games of all time. The amount of time I have poured into it is immense and i'm still not bored, that takes skill and a good game to do. I got introduced to this game by my friend during Covid Lockdown (2021) and first though this game was not that good as I was not good at it, I picked it back up around the end of 2023 again and was instantly hooked and still play it to this day. At the moment I am 70% done with the game and will make my mission to 100% the game as not alot of people have done it and I want to be known to be one of them. I usually play this game when I am talking to my friends as a background thing to do. I cannot begin to tell you how much this game means to me</blockquote></p>

          <h5>The Binding Of Isaac is based on the hebrew Bible story "The Akedah" or better known as "The Binding".<br> This story is one of the most known and most traumatic story in The Bible. In it, God orders Abraham to kill his son, Isaac, on Mount Moriah.</h5>

            Does this game have a Board Game? I am not much of a gamer.
          </summary>
            It indeed does! It is called "The Binding Of Isaac: Four Souls". The mission of the game is to beat mobs and bosses until you get Four Souls. You loot and spend money to get Items and Trinkets that will buff you to oblivion! This does have multiplayer with it which can be pretty brutal as there are no rules about deals so anyone of your friends can betray you in an instant. Its a highly fun game to play in a party.
